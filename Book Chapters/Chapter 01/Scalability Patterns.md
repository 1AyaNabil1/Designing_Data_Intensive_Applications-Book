- Load balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple servers (e.g., using a round-robin algorithm).
- Caching: Store frequently accessed data in memory (e.g., Redis or Memcached).
- Partitioning: Split data across nodes (e.g., sharding a database by user ID).
- Example: Netflix uses horizontal scaling to handle millions of streaming requests.
